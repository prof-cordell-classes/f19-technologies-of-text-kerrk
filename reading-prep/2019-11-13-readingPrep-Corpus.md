## Questions or Observations

1. While reading, “‘Fugitive Verses’: The Circulation of Poems in Nineteenth-Century American Newspapers” I was struck by how *alive* newspapers were. My twenty first century brain tends to think of newspapers as a static medium. To me, the content of newspapers is highly tied to the individual book object that held that information. This misconception was interrogated by the idea that, 
>“The newspaper exchange system was simultaneously the broadest and least controllable distribution channel for poets during the period. Poems traveled far and fast through reprinting, but their form, authorship and reception were distributed through a highly variable network over which typical literary authorities has little say” (Cordell, Mullen). 

Reading this helped me better conceptualize nineteenth-century newspapers for what they actually were. They weren’t just vessels of the day’s news, they were the pages where literary culture were cultivated. They were active with reprints, distribution, and sharing. The whole network was far more live, and far more similar to today’s internet than I had previously imagined. 

2. And if the medium of the newspaper equates to the medium of the internet, then the parody poems of “Beautiful Snow” function as memes. When people can create humor, and share it with an audience of people they’ve never met *irl*, and the audience can understand the humor based on shared, cultural knowledge – that’s a meme. Because the parodies of “Beautiful Snow” work based on the shared cultural knowledge of the poem’s content as well as the dispute over authorship, then they effectively are functioning as the equivalent of modern day memes.  

3. I really enjoyed the viewpoint of Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein in, “What Gets Counted Counts,” because they didn’t shy away from the ugly truth about why data gets collected. In the opening example with Facebook and gender, the authors emphasize that although on the surface Facebook looks very progressive when it comes to self-proclaiming one’s own gender, they still use a binary classification system when it comes to data presentation to advertisers. In reality, the true reason for our advanced data collection processes all boils down to using that information to sell us.
