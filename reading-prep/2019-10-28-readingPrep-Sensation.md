# Reading Prep: Chapter 8: Sensation

## Questions or Observations

1. In “The End of Books,” Octave Uzanne describes a world where people listen to recordings of people reading books. Print has become obsolete, and instead, everyone embraces an audio medium. Although this is the exact function of audiobooks, this medium didn’t take off in the way Uzanne predicted. Rather than replacing print, audiobooks are more of a niche format that exists alongside print. Uzanne’s prediction about a new way to consume storytelling mediums is inaccurate because he was unable to image such a thing as a video. Although Uzanne invents an imaginative system that projects images associated with the story, they’re still images. Uzanne is imagining the function of videos and movies, but cannot fathom the technology associated with them. 

2. In 99% Invisible, “The Universal Page,” Braille is described as a means of increasing access to education. Although this is true, we must also acknowledge that it is also a very privileged language. You can only learn how to read it if you go to a special school for the blind, or if your local public school has enough resources for a decent specialized education program. Although Braille *is* a means of increasing access to education, there are still significant strides to be made before it is accessible to all blind people.   

3. In “All Technology Is Assistive: Six Design Rules on Disability,” Sara Hendren breaks down common misconceptions about the “us/them distinction between able-minded/able-bodied and disabled.” Typically, we view these as different categories a person can fall into, but we must realize that they’re not mutually exclusive. A person can be able-bodied, but mentally “disabled.” (And I put “disabled” in quotes because definitions vary drastically from person to person, institution to institution). Hendren also emphasizes that disability design should not focus on “passing as normal.” There is no singular definition of an able-minded or able-bodied person. This distinction is important to make *socially* as well as when concerning design.
