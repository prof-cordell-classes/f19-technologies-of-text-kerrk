# Reading Prep: Chapter 7: Format

## Questions or Observations

1. In “Baxter’s Procustes,” Baxter originally protests the publication of his “poetry,” saying his work was not good enough to be published. In order to avoid mass criticism, only 50 copies of the “collection” were to be printed. Charles W. Chesnutt describes this process as a means to keep the edition “in the hands of friends” (785). By only printing a select few, this process effectively shifted the “poetry collection” from commodity to artifact. With mass printing productions, it is easy to see the codex as object without having a great amount of value. However, with this very selective printing, and very elite distributing process, it is much easier to fathom how Baxter pulled off his charade. This kind of “prank” could not be as easily accomplished today, where individual books are commodities, rather than artifacts. 

2. In Jane Austen’s letters to her sister Cassandra, she mentions various errors the printers made when composing her work. For example, in her January 29th letter, she mentions various “typical errors” where the printers left out various phrases like “said he” or “said she.” Additionally, in her February 4th letter, she points out how the printers seemed to have merged to speeches into one. Were the printers doing this to save space? How can printers change the meaning of a work in their composition? How should scholars account for the variation in authorial intent and printed result? Are they noteworthy enough to be acknowledged in literary discussions?

3.  In “Reading on the Move,” Price focuses in on a key point best summed up by the quote: 
> “The genre being read mattered as much as the kind of person doing the reading – and the pace at which books were read mattered as much as the time of the day at which that reading happened.” 

Price explains that the type of reading, place of reading, and time of reading have always mattered. These concerns still continue today. For example, I would never curl up into bed with my Rhetoric textbook and I would never lay out my Ali Wong memoir on a library study desk. We continue to associate different genres of books with different reading behaviors. These varying behaviors persist across varying mediums. For example, I would never sit down with a bowl of popcorn to watch a disturbing documentary, but I would with a comedy film. The genre of our content impacts the way we consume it.
