# Reading Prep: Algorithm

## Questions or Observations

1. In the first chapter of the comic, Sydney Padua strictly describes the historical truth, while in the remaining chapters, she delves into her alternate “pocket universe.” Juxtaposing the historical and the imaginary seems to aid in the creation of meaning in this comic. For example, when explaining imaginary numbers, it is almost as if the historical stories are the “real numbers that go to left to right” while the alternate steampunk universe exists as the imaginary numbers going “up and down.” (228-9)   

2. Instead of crowding her beautiful illustrations with paragraphs of text, Padua makes use of extensive footnotes and endnotes. Effectively, this changes the “reading action.” Instead of allowing your eyes to follow linearly from left to right, top to bottom on each page, Padua creates her own “reading action.” This action is best suited for the format and the information being conveyed. Although it takes some getting used to, this new reading action allows for the incorporation of a lot of interesting information that otherwise would’ve been lost to limitations the medium of comic books. 

3. What genre should we classify this work as? Wikipedia lists its genre as Steampunk, however, I’d categorize that as an aesthetic genre rather than a literary one. Because Sydney Padua takes characters from history and uses them as instruments in her own story – should we classify it as fan fiction? Based off the lengthy foot and endnotes, it is clear Padua spent countless hours researching their lives of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage – so should we classify it as historical fiction? Or does the format – a comic – ultimate dictate which genre it belongs to?
