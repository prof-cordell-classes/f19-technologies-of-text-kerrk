## Questions or Observations

1.In “Two Wordbooks” from *The Information*, James Gleick incorporates Robert Cawdrey’s definitions into his syntax as a way of familiarizing his readers with Cawdrey’s methodology. For example:

> “No one knows how many copies the printer made. There are no records (“**records**, writings layde up for remembrance). A single copy made its way to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, which has preserved it.” 

In this case, Cawdrey’s definition of “record” isn’t relevant to the meaning of the sentence. Presumably, most of Gleick’s readers *know* what a record is. By adding this definition, Cawdrey’s definition, readers get a better sense of what his dictionary truly is. Including supporting evidence in this way is unconventional, but effective. Should this alternative formatting be welcomed into the literary canon or shunned in favor of more standard conventions like MLA? (On a similar vein, if we shun these minorly unconventional writing methods, what should we make of pieces like *David Walker’s Appeal*?)

2.Languages are inherently ever-changing, hence, documenting them feels like an attempt to fossilize, or solidify something that is still alive. As James Glick describes of the English language: “As hard as the [Oxford English Dictionary] tries to embody the language’s fluidity, it cannot help but serve as an agent of its crystallization.” Even when works acknowledge the dynamic nature of languages, is the very act of documentation a form of “crystallization?” In the terms of the Cherokee language as discussed in Ellen Cushman’s, “We’re Taking the Genius of Sequoyah into This Century,” would a Cherokee dictionary help preserve the language? Or is this form of documentation too static, and too far removed from the language itself? 

3.As Bonnie Mak describes in, “Architectures of the Page,” people read many different types of books “…sometimes on papyrus, sometimes on parchment and sometimes on paper” (15). When teaching these historical texts today, is it important to note the technologies they were written on? For example, is it important while having a discussion about the Greek texts, is important to also have a discussion about the scrolls they were written on, which “encourage[d] a practice of continuous reading” (12)?
