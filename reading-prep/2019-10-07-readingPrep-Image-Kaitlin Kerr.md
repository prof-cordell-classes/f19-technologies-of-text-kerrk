## Questions or Observations

1. In William Blake’s prints, although the text and images are identical, there are drastic shifts in the coloring of each copy. The change from warm toned yellows to striking dark navy has an effect on the piece’s tone. When analyzing these poems literary, is it important to comment on the accompanying images? If so, how should one grapple with the myriad of versions?

2. In *The Book*, Borsuk describes a piece of performance art composed by Anne Hamilton in which a 
>“performer peels text out of hardbound books whose pages are scored boustrophedon-style, allowing line after line to be lifted away in a single strand like an orange peel” (190).

How does our definition of “book” change with this added dramatic element of performance? When the act of “reading” effectively destroys the medium, how should we preserve these performances?

3. In *The Book*, Borsuk concludes the chapter with the thought:
> “Defining the book involves consideration for its use as much as form. Our changing idea of the book is co-constitutive of its changing structure” (195).

As the structure of our “book as idea” changes, how should we continue to re-structure our definition?
