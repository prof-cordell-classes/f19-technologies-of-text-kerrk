## Questions or Observations

1. In “The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species,” Liu describes five fantastical methods of reading. Each method is unique, but as with good science fiction, seems somehow otherworldly possible. In our selection from Phaedrus, Socrates describes “a famous old god, whose name was Theuth” who’s “greatest discovery was the use of letters” (Plato). In both works, there is a connection between the process of reading and the supernatural. Why do we, as humans, believe in a connection between writing and the supernatural? Is the idea of reading ethereal? One of Liu’s species, the “Hesperoe,” takes an interesting viewpoint on writing, 

>“A book, they thought, was not a living mind yet pretended to be one … it could not be interrogated like a real person, could not answer its critics or justify its accounts” (Liu). 

Interestingly, Socrates held a similar view that, 

>“once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves” (Plato). 

Is this quality that causes a distrust in writing (in both fictional and historic philosophers) what makes writing supernatural? 

2. In the first chapter of *What We Talk About When We Talk About Books,* Price describes a popularly disliked YouTube video featuring a woman cutting the spines off novels to create a decorative box. Price explains the video received widespread hate because the people watching were treating the book, 

>“…as a cue for certain actions (reading, not handling), certain attitudes (respecting, not repurposing), certain rules (look, don’t touch)” (Price 21). 

Do these cues extend to other forms of print media? (I know my entire apartment adores my roommate’s spread of beloved New Yorker covers on the wall.) Do the same “rules” apply to newspapers? Paperbacks? Hardcovers? Magazines? First editions? Why or why not?

As Gitelman explains in *Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture*:

>“The technology and all of its supporting protocols (that you answer “Hello?” and that you the pay the company, but also standards like touch-tones and twelve volt lines) have become self-evident as the result of social processes, including the habits associated with the other, related media.” (Gitelman 5-6)

Are the “cues” Price describes simply Gitelman’s “self-evident supporting protocols?”

3. In Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture, Gitelman defines the “data of culture” as: 

>“…records and documents, the archivable bits or irreducible pieces of modern culture that seem archivable under prevailing and evolving knowledge structures, and that thus suggest, demand, or defy preservation. History in this sense is no less of a cultural production in the past than it is in the present” (Gitelman 12).

Whose job is it to collect and preserve bits of culture? How can we collect culture while it is still occurring? Who should decide what piece of culture is “irreducible?” One day a single-use-plastic grocery bag may be obsolete, but does that mean it should be archived?
