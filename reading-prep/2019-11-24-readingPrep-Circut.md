# Reading Prep: Circuit

## Questions or Observations

1. In “Future Reading,” Craig Mod presents the idea that “the physical book becomes a true souvenir of the reading experience.” At the height of the Kindle’s popularity, I too was an avid e-reader, but would often ask my mother to buy me the print editions of e-books. Although I knew it wasn’t logical, I would also want my own copies of the books I’d read at the library. There seems to be this great desire to want an object that proves that you read a book. I find the idea of a codex as a “souvenir” of your reading experience highly accurate and charmingly phrased.

2. I was particularly struck by the quote: 

>“When media is too locked down, too rigid, when it’s too much like a room with most of the air sucked out of it, stale and exhausting, the exploration stops.” 

I really liked this line because I thought it was very attuned to the themes of this course – the media affects the content. When the media allows for artistic license, or “exploration,” creators embrace the opportunity. (I think that’s partly what is attractive about zines. The media allows for this type of exploration.) 

3. I thought the medium of Jon Bois’ “What Football Will Look Like in the Future,” was very striking. It was fascinating how he combined text, video, and gif to make a (more or less) comprehensive storyline. I particularly enjoyed the opening chapter, “Please Answer Me” where the action of reading interacts with the content being read. Scrolling through the calendar pages is a time-consuming action, and the reader becomes just as impatient waiting for a response as Nine does. While I thought the medium was interesting, I would love to see a story that wasn’t so *cerebral* played out in this way. I imagine that if the content was a bit more accessible, the reader wouldn’t be overwhelmed by both the medium and the message.
