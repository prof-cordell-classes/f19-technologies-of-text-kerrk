## Questions or Observations

1.In the excerpts from Johannes Trithemius, *In Praise of Scribes*, the primary source of admiration comes from the very human element in the creation/copying of the written word. Trithemius romanticizes the fact that *human* hands wrote out each individual letter of each individual word – calling it “sacred labor” that “extends [the scribe’s] own and the letters’ lifespan for ages.” In this idealistic viewpoint, who holds the power: the scribe, the author, or the words? As Amaranth Borsuk writes in *The Book,* 

> “Philosopher and theorist Walter Benjamin’s seminal essay ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its Mechanical Reproducibility’ (1935) suggests that the photography, miniaturization, and distribution of images in the late nineteenth century destroyed the ‘aura’ of art by abstracting it from the hand of the person who created it” (76).

In this age of “abstraction,” how do we create a power dynamic between content and creator?

2.In chapter two of *The Book,* Borsuk explains: “…many of the features we now associate with the codex arose in response to silent readership” (61). Now more than ever, people are listening to music as they read. Although the practice does not alter the physical codex, how has this practice changed the way we read? How has this practice changed the way we listen to music?

3.As Chris Gayomali writes in his article, the aesthetic nature of fonts influences the way readers think about the words they’re reading. In your own experience, has a font or typeface ever impacted the way you read a text? 

This article made me remember the alternating use of fonts in the Junie B. Jones chapter books. The start of each chapter would feature a diary entry in a different font from the rest of the chapter. The diary entry font was made to look like a young child wrote it, and I distinctly remember when I was first learning how to read chapter books thinking to myself that the parts with this font were much easier for me to read. Does a font’s readability change as your ability to read change?
