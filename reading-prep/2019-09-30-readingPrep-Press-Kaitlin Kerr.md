## Questions or Observations

1. In "Look!! Look!!! at This!!!!: The Radical Typography of David Walker's 'Appeal,'" Marcy J. Dinius describes a work that conveys as much meaning in the typography as the words themselves. Specifically, she describes: “The voice and the emotion in the text are visible and thereby audible in its typography – in the printed form of words that Walker speaks through the text and wants voiced to those who cannot read” (Dinius 57). The incorporation of unconventional typography enhances the meaning of the speech and was designed for an audience of people who could not read. Because this type of typography was so impactful in creating meaning, could we put it to any use today? For example, with the dictation of speeches? Subtitles? 

2. In Leah Price’s *What We Talk About When We Talk About Books*, she writes: “From the beginning, printed books were more often borrowed than owned” (60). Does this fact still hold true today? Although I love filling my bedroom with things I’ve read, most of the codices I’ve read throughout my life have been *borrowed* from a library. (Whether it be my hometown’s public library or Northeastern’s bookstore.) Additionally, do many people today view books as “disposable single-use items that you didn’t want cluttering up your shelves once their brief life expectancy has elapsed…” (Price 60)? What do you speculate caused this shift? 

3. In an attempt to persuade the public mind to be more accepting of women in printshops, Emily Faithfull writes: “The difference between a good printer and a bad one, is rather the quality of mind and the care applied to the work, than in the knowledge of the work itself” (Faithfull 39). Although the inclusion of women in the workforce is an inherently feminist notion, should this line still be considered feminist today?
