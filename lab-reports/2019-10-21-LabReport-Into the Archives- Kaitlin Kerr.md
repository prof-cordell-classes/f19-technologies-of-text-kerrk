# Lab Report: Into the Archive

#### Kaitlin Kerr

## Process Description
On October 9th, the class went to the Northeastern Archives. There were two collections on display: an assortment of historical codices and a collection of modern artists books. After spending some time interacting with the historical codices, we discussed different elements of the texts. For example, we questioned why margin-esque lines appeared on a printed volume. If the text was not handwritten, when what functional purpose did these margins serve? Well, it turns out they didn’t serve a functional purpose at all. These lines were * skeuomorphic *, meaning they’re an element of design that *used* to be functional, but now merely serve an aesthetic purpose. Another element of skeuomorphic design we saw in the collection were a pair of clasps on the exterior of a codex. This particular codex was a modern-day reproduction of a historical text made to look older than it really was. The clasps keeping the back and front covers together were originally used to keep paper made from animal skin flat, keeping it from warping. The paper of the reproduction was made from wood pulp, thus, in no danger of warping. Including the clasps on this work was meant to serve an aesthetic purpose, rather than a functional one. We were also given the opportunity to handle various artist books in the archives. Pictured below is one of my favorites from the collection, featuring paper moving parts that plays with the reader’s perception of what it means to read.

On October 16th, the class went to the Massachusetts Historical Society. For our visit, the archivists pulled a collection of works pertaining to children’s literature. Among these works was a hieroglyphic “baa baa black sheep” nursery rhyme, a guide to being a well-bred girl, and a guide to being a well-bred boy.

## Observations
I can’t say I was surprised by the existence of the gendered manners books. We still have these books today. In fact, I can remember my own copy of *The Girl’s Book of Glamour: A Guide to Being a Goddess* and the antithetical *The Boy’s Book of Survival: How to Survive Anything, Anywhere*. The *Goddess* book was there to teach you every at-home skincare ritual required of a young lady and the *Survival* book was there to teach you every knot required of a young boy scout. Although I did not have the opportunity to explore the manner books from the 1800s at length, from what I could gather, the skills described in each copy varied tremendously with gender. While the well-bred girl book emphasized the importance of skills like sewing, the well-bred boy book emphasized the importance of having a good time with friends. Twenty years ago, (when I was growing up) “how to be a girl/boy” books could be found at any Barnes and Nobel. While there may not still be a large market for these kinds of books today, it would be interesting to study the popularity and prevalence of these books throughout American history. (Especially considering the changing content.)

At the Massachusetts Historical Society, we had a brief discussion acknowledging the type of people these artifacts came from. In the 1800s, a family had to be wealthy if they were spending any money *at all* on books. But if they were spending money on books for children, the families belonged to an *ultra-wealthy tier*. It is important to note these privileges when considering the story these artifacts tell. The girl’s and boy’s books were specifically intended for those who are “well-bred.” This does not discount these artifacts, but rather, it puts them into perspective. The average person would not have access to the means to read these books, rather, it was a specific type of person these texts were available to. When considering the artist books of the Northeastern Archives, we must also take note that these works aren’t meant for the every-day consumer. These books are made for people who live in an income bracket where they can comfortably spend money on art. While art is an extraordinary product of the human mind, it does not serve much of a functional purpose. (Perhaps with the exception of burning it to keep warm). It is not enough to realize the privilege of the people of the past, we must also be aware of the privilege of the artifacts we select when curating our archives today. 

## Analysis
In “Two Wordbooks,” James Gleick describes the creation of two dictionaries: the Cawdrey “Tale Alphabeticall” and the first Oxford English Dictionary (OED).  

The Cawdrey wordbook was meant to be more of a collection of difficult every-day words defined for the common person. When Cawdrey was collecting his words, people had a much different relationship with language than they do now. There was no proper usage or spelling, as Gleick describes it: 

>“Language did not function as a storehouse of words, from which users could common the correct items, preformed. On the contrary, words were fugitive, on the fly, expected to vanish again thereafter. When spoken, they were not available to be compared with, or measured against, other instantiations of themselves.”

In a way, Cawdrey’s wordbook creation was an archival activity. If the function of an archive is to collect information or establish records, then “Tale Alphabeticall” was starting to establish a “storehouse of words.” His intention was never to create a complete list of every word used in the English language, instead, by picking and choosing words to define, Cawdrey was effectively anthologizing English. 

This idea of creating a language archive continued with the OED. Yet, it is a vastly different project than Cawdrey’s wordbook. While the wordbook was more of a starting point, the OED was meant to be a collection of every English word. Additionally, the intention of the OED is to declare that the meaning of words come from other words (Gleick). Because of the English language’s ever-changing nature, the OED needed to be modern and constantly updated. Gleick described this paradox as: 

>“As hard as the OED tries to embody the language’s fluidity, it cannot help but serve as an agent of its crystallization.” 

Although this dictionary is meant to be a living, breathing, changing document, the sheer act of creating a collection of words “crystallizes” the language. The OED is effectively a snapshot of how the language was used at a specific time. Similar to an archive, this collection of words has preserved a language.   

When considering “Tale Alphabeticall” in the context of the archival objects we’ve visited in class, the dragon prayer book is most reminiscent of Cawdrey’s work. Both were intended for every-day use by the masses. Although the dragon prayer book is a medieval manuscript, and only one copy has the same exact appearance as the one the Northeastern archives holds, it is still a very personal object. The women who used this book most likely knew all of the prayers it contains by heart, and the book often leaves most of them incomplete. Similarly, “Tale Alphabeticall” also assumes its readers know the definitions of certain words by heart already. It is not meant to serve as a complete guide to English words, rather, it is meant as a selective record.  

When considering the OED in the context of the archival objects we’ve visited, the artist books are the most similar. Many of the artist books, including the one pictured above, contain moving parts. The OED is meant to be a “moving” archive of words, constantly changing as the English language changes. The OED and the artist books are both privileged objects. While Cawdrey’s wordbook was meant to serve the masses, the OED is more of a privileged project, with its first edition presented to the likes of King George V and President Calvin Coolidge (Gleick). Today artist books are purchased by a privileged group of people with disposable income. The OED and artist books we examined are similar in that they both contain elements of change and were intended for a more privileged audience.
