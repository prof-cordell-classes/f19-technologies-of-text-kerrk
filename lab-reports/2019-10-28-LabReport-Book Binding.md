# Lab Report: Lab 7: Book Binding

#### Kaitlin Kerr

## Process Description

In this lab, we bound our little book of Twitterbot poems. We started by folding our double-sided printed poem sheets in half, then creasing the folds with bone folders. Although simply folding by hand yields pretty accurate results, we used bone folders to ensure the folds were perfect. Next, we marked where we would pierce the paper. There were 5 stations, positioned at 1.25 inches, 2.75 inches, 4.25 inches, 5.75 inches, and 7.25 inches. We chose these positions for the stations because they are equidistant from each other, with the middle station in the center of the 8.5-inch side of the paper. To ensure puncturing the stations would not tear the rest of the pages, we used a book cradle. We then wove a long piece of thread in an intricate pattern through the stations to bind the pages together.

## Observations
I was surprised at how relatively easy this process was. In fact, I’m surprised I’d never encountered this activity in an at-home craft guide before. Although acquiring all of these specialized materials created a bit of a barrier to entry, I feel like their functions could be easily replicated by various household items. Instead of using an awl, at home I could’ve punched through each paper individually with a thick needle. The weaving pattern for the binding was no more complicated then some of the knotted friendship bracelet or knitting patterns I’ve seen printed in craft guides from my own childhood. Maybe I was part of a select few kids who would’ve enjoyed this kind of activity. Still, I remember making my own paper in grade school – why not expand the project a bit further and use that paper to bind my own notebook? Maybe it’s because parents wouldn’t want their kids playing with potentially dangerous sewing needles? My parents never had problems with me learning how to sew by hand when I was young. Why wasn’t this a craft a part of my childhood? 

I finished binding my poetry book a bit early, so I used the extra time to bind a little notebook for myself. I used a few more pages than we did for the poetry book, and was surprised by how uneven it made the edges of the notebook. Nesting even two more pages into the binding made all of the difference. This discovery forced me to imagine the complexities of binding 500-page codices. 

## Analysis

In “Baxter’s Procustes,” readers are more connected to the process of creating a codex. They personally know the man “writing” the material, and are involved in the binding process. In fact, their connection to the binding is greater than their connection to the content of the book. Charles W. Chesnutt remarks not on Baxter’s words (or lack thereof), instead he remarks on the book as object:

> “‘…The dark green cover, elaborately tooled, the old English lettering, the heavy linen paper, mark this as one of our very choicest publications. The letter press is of course De Vinne’s best – there is nothing better on this side of the Atlantic. The text is beautiful, slender stream, meandering gracefully through a wide meadow of margin.’” (789)

Before this lab, I’d never really considered the binding as an essential part of the codex creation process. My mind always emphasized the importance of the author’s role in content creation and the publisher’s role in editing. I was narrow-mindedly fixated on the book as content. Chesnutt has the absolute inverse view as I did – completely focusing as the book as object. 

I can only predict that Chesnutt was able to see the book as object because he was not as far removed from the codex creation process as I am. Like I mentioned in my Observation section, I’m thoroughly surprised that I’d never bound a little book myself before this lab. As book binding became industrialized and codices were no longer bound for the individual, the process fell out of the imaginations of consumers. When I go to a book store, I don’t have to think about how the pages of a codex are held together, so it is not in my contemporary idea of what making a book *is.* 

Although I don’t think our modern imaginations should resemble Chesnutt’s, sorely focused on the book as object, I also believe consumers should have more of a connection to the creation of books. If we learn how book-objects are made, by making our own, then perhaps we can start to see books as both objects and content.
