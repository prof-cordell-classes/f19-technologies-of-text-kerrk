# Lab Report: Mark(it all)down

## Process Description

In our first lab of the year, we spent time familiarizing ourselves with “GitHub.” GitHub is a software that allows you to create and share files using the “Markdown” language. Markdown is a way to write that includes formatting into the formation of each sentence. The lab started simply, creating a new account and downloading a new application, but it quickly turned into an exploration of places I’d never discovered in my computer before. Instead of properly adding the technologies of text classroom to my computer, I downloaded it as a ZIP file. This would not enable me to utilize GitHub in the way Professor Cordell had intended. By simply downloading the classroom, I merely created a copy of the lab report and reading prep templates locally on my laptop. Instead, I needed to allow the files on my computer to communicate with the classroom repository so I could “commit” my coursework to “master” (effectively turning it in).  

Once I, with the help of Professor Cordell, figured out how to fix my downloading error, I was tasked with finding a Markdown preview application that would work with my Windows computer. Just about everyone else in my class uses Mac, so I was on my own to test all of Professor Cordell’s recommendations on his website. After some trial and error, I discovered that none of the downloadable ones worked with Windows 10, so instead, I used “Hashify” to visualize what my Markdown writing looked like. Once I got to this step, I was truly able to play around and see how using asterisks and octothorpes formatted a page of Markdown. 

## Observations

This lab introduced me to a new way to create documents. I was always accustomed to using Microsoft Word or Google Docs, I’d never considered another alternative. I knew I had the free “Notepad” application pre-installed on my laptop, but I didn’t think I could format text using it, so I never considered it a viable option for writing. (I also found Notepad’s lack of spellcheck a serious deterrent). Little did I know that using Notepad in combination with GitHub and the Markdown language would allow me to write *with* formatting in a way that was both simple and elegant. (However, I’m still in the process of finding a spellcheck option). 

Although there will definitely be a learning curve adapting to these new programs, my goal is to keep an open mind this semester. What particularly frustrated me during this lab was my own ignorance. I didn’t realize the scope of my own limitations regarding textual technology. What surprised me was my adaptability. Even though I first learned about GitHub and Markdown a few days ago, I figured out how to navigate them with relative ease. Instead of hitting a wall, I was delighted to find adding formatting elements such as asterisks and octothorpes was only a minor adjustment. 

## Analysis
A program, like GitHub, with the intention of creating shareable text becomes a new type of “book object.” Using the Borsuk definition she explains in the opening of *The Book:* 

> “The book, after all, is a portable data storage and distribution method…” (1)

to Borsuk, “books” are anything “portable” that stores information or “data. Taking this loose definition of what a “book” is into account, we can begin to see programs as their own type of “books.” Although not a physical codex, GitHub allows users to create, save, and share text. GitHub effectively is a constantly updatable intangible “data storage and distribution method.” Its portability can be debated – if you think about GitHub as a room full of servers, I suppose it is not easily transportable; but if you think about GitHub as a *service* that can be accessed from your laptop, your phone, or any object with internet capabilities, then it becomes portable. 

Looking at GitHub as a book also allows us to see Markdown as the “genre” of language best adapted for this medium. Markdown is not exactly its own language – it still uses the majority of the same elements as standard English, but reading words surrounded by asterisk marks definitely is a different method of reading than just the outright *italicized text.* When thinking about this “different method,” the rhetoric is not dissimilar from different methods of literacy. As Vee paraphrases in “Computer Programming as Literacy:” 

> “‘Procedural literacy,’ for Ian Bogost, ‘entails the ability to reconfigure concepts and rules to understand processes, not just on the computer, but in general.’ In this definition, Bogost equates literacy more with reading than writing – the understanding of processes rather than the representation of them” (9).  

To write using the Markdown “genre” of language is similar to the process of writing standard English. But understanding the process of reading Markdown is a new set of skills. From what I understand, once I write a formatting symbol into a Markdown aware program, it will “read” that text and create corresponding HTML code, which will, in turn, generate the desired formatted text in a browser. By becoming aware of this process, I’ve gained a new type of “procedural literacy.” 

I wonder about the ways I will utilize differing technologies in conjunction with different forms of literacy. By taking this course, I am becoming aware of the intricate histories of any codex I hold in my hands. I am becoming attuned to the habits of a reader. I am becoming aware that with all things, as Gitelman explains in *Always Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture:*

> “The technology and all of its supporting protocols … have become self-evident as the result of social processes, including the habits associated with the other, related media” (5-6).

Looking forward, I am left curious about how combining different types of literacy will change these “supporting protocols.” What social processes are associated with Markdown? What protocols govern GitHub? What habits (prehaps even ones I'm unconsciously engaging in currently) will one day become "self-evident?"
