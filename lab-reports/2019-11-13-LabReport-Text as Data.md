# Lab Report: Text as Data

#### Kaitlin Kerr

## Process Description

In the first part of the lab, we worked with an r studio to gain familiarity with the programming language “r,” and how it can be utilized to analyze text. We’ve already become familiar with some of the conventions of Markdown by writing our lab reports and reading prep assignments in Markdown aware documents. This was the “next step,” where we weren’t just using symbols to change the font of the text, but we were truly using code to help create meaning. Although we didn’t really write any of the code ourselves, we ran the “tidyverse” and “tidytext” libraries, and changed a few variables here and there. Specifically, we had to store text data as a variable so we could manipulate it. We started off by inserting *Scenes of Clerical Life*, by George Eliot (which also happens to be the text that Lovelace and Babbage process with their own “difference engine”). Once we imported the text as data, we could begin to play with it. 

In the second part of the lab, we talked about the function of “Ngrams.” To my understanding, an Ngram function will scan all of the texts it has access to find whatever combination of N words appears the most frequently. This function can be used to examine a vast corpus of texts relatively quickly. In the Viral Texts Project, Ngrams are utilized to discover content that was reproduced across newspapers without sifting through each page individually.  

## Observations
As a person with a humanities-aligned-English-major brain, I was really worried about labs like this one. They’re focused on coding, which I have a *non-existent* background in. Thankfully, I didn’t have to write anything from scratch. Instead, I simply ran already existing code, only manipulating it slightly. Although the code was very simple, I found conceptualizing it aching my brain. It may have just been that we were trying to learn a lot in a short period of time, but it was hard to not get bogged down in the little details. I found myself focusing (and trying to write down a copious amount of notes about) the process of assigning and naming variables, instead of the (arguably more important) method of manipulating the variables. 

I think that without reading *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*, I wouldn’t have been able to figure out what was going on. Specifically, my mind kept going back to these panels:

After Mary Evans, aka George Eliot, sends her manuscript into the difference engine, it is turned into data. Because the text is physical, it is shown being ripped apart into individual pages, lines, and letters. These individual bits of paper are then fed into the machine to be “read” and then turned into punch cards. For me, it was difficult to picture the code manipulating text because I couldn’t *see* what was going on. It was not operating in physical space, and I had no visual reference to explain what was happening. This comic serves as an artistic representation of what the code was doing to the text, so it made sense to me. It imagines a machine tearing apart a page with cartoonish scissors into individual letters. This comic is so brilliant because it turns the abstract into something physical, using familiar terms to explain foreign concepts. 

## Analysis
It is important to have bridges between types of literacy. Most people think that coding is beyond them (like I did). A large part of this perception stems from the fact most people don’t have access to Computer Science until university. And once students reach university, the foreign CS concepts are taught in terms of mathematics. Content like *The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage* makes computing more accessible. 

Sydney Padula’s book takes something that is intimidating and turns it into something readable, silly even. It uses the “terms” of humanities-minded people, like biography and history and literature, and uses it to explain scientific content. In addition to merging genres, I love the way it also integrates different genres of form. Ranging from history to fantasy to comedy, everyone can find something they enjoy in the thrilling adventures. 

Although we used Padula’s book as a jumping off point to talk about code, there is an essential irony here. This book cannot be “read” in r studio. *Scenes of Clerical Life* can be used as a variable because Project Gutenberg transformed the book from a physical codex, into a block of plain lettering. Because it was devoid of things like formatting and illustration, we could use it as a variable and play around with it. But *The Thrilling Adventures* is a complex maze of formatting, illustration, footnotes, and diagrams. Even if it was a part of the public domain, (and thus, not protected by copyright,) a scan of the book wouldn’t hold the same meaning as the physical codex. (Even some of my peers that read the e-book version for class stated they were at a loss when the footnotes ran from one page onto the other or the page required that the reader turn it upside down.) I’m not a computer scientist, but I can imagine the images don’t hold up very well scanned through an Optical Character Reader. So even if we did have a copy of Padula’s work to insert as a variable in r studio, we wouldn’t be able to use our methods of text analysis.
